            <li>I'm primarily an illustrator. I have never worked with html before and I'm taking this class for my major, and I'm excited to learn!</li>
            <li>I don't have any experience. </li>
            <li>I hope to learn the basics of html.</li>
            <li>You have to adjust design on the screen for different devices. Sometimes the screen can distort design as well.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.martinvenezky.com/">Martinvenezky.com</a> is an effective design because it's eye catching and all his artwork is accessible from the front page. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.mikeperrystudio.com/">MikePerry.com</a> is an effective example of communication because it clearly communicates he is an illustrator and an animator. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.eugeniayoh.com/work">EugeniaYoh.com</a></li> is an effective website because the laylout is extremely accesible and conveys that she is a multifaceted artist</li>
