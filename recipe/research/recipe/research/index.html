                        <p>This website is fun and engaging through it's use of bright colors and nice images.</p>
                        <p>It's unfortunate that I have to scroll all the way to the bottom for the actual recipe.</p>

                        <p>The typeface is very engaing and has a very eloquent feel. 
                        <p>The recipe also begins as soon as you start reading.</p>
                        <p>There is no ordered list so it makes it a little harder to follow the steps. </p>

                        <p>The ingredients and directions are clearly listed at the top of the page. </p>
                        <p>There is an option to save the recipe so the viewer won't loose it.</p>
                        <p>It also provides the time and the level of difficulty which is helpful.</p>

                        <p>This website makes a point to draw you in with its images.</p>
                        <p>While the menu is secondary, it is easily visible and accessible from the home page.</p>
                        <p>I think this website does a good job of drawing you in, while remaining functional which is something I hope to implement in my process.</p>

                        </p>This website is assuming the needs of the viewer by providing products on the home page.
                        <p>In doing so, they are providing a good representation of what they have to offer.</p>
                        <p>I think an important element of design is recognizing the user's needs without them having to tell you.</p>

                        <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a>
                        <p>This website hides the menu from the viewer and instead provides them with articles to start reading.</p>
                        <p>I also really enjoy the attention to type on this website.</p>
                        <p>I think the simplicity of The New Yorker is a quality I hope to implement into my designs in order to streamline information.</p>
